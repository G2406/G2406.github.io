Project Name:
 
Silent Notes Studios

Project Description:
 
Silent Notes Studios is a website created to showcase a company that specializes in music lessons. The website has a variety of classes for multiple types of instruments such as: strings, percussion, keyboard, brass and woodwinds. Users can book any instrument from these options simply by clicking on the type and picking a date and timing. Not only is the website meant to allow users to book classes but it also has a short film trailer that the website promotes and advertises. 

Concepts and Themes:

The overall concepts and themes that the website follows is making music accessible to all people. The company heavily preaches its message of helping people achieve their dreams. Hence why the website is promoting the short film. The company promotes creativity, passion, and allows students the opportunity to express themselves through music. 

Experience: 

On a surface level, I wanted users to experience a proper musical company. To be able to book classes, pick their instruments, look at reviews, and even contact the company.  On a deeper level, I wanted to give users a level of excitement as they navigated a passionate company and be inspired by both the message from the video and the website. I wanted to encourage users to consider trying out a new artistic hobby through the design and description. 

Process: 

It took a while for me to properly get used to coding on such a big scale. Due to the fact I lacked a lot of coding experience, navigating the template and figuring out which bits go where ended up causing a lot of frustration. However, the longer I worked on the website the easier and funner it was to implement new ideas that went beyond my basic idea from my wireframe. 

Layout of Website
In my original wireframe I had planned the website to simply be one page in which every function the user needed was already there. I ended up changing this during the application process as I was afraid that shoving everything onto one page would make the page cluttered and messy. It would also limit what I could and could not add due to the limited space on the index/home page. 

Straying from the Wireframe
In the end I still chose to keep most of the website’s descriptions and pictures in its home page. However, the most important functions of the websites were put on a separate page so that users would be able to access a lot more and go a lot more in-depth. This can be seen in both the shop and the video page. When you press the ‘learn more’ button on the shop page, you are taken to a separate page in order to fill out the booking details and so on. For the video page, I originally wanted the video to be the center focus on the home page, but after trying out a bunch of styles I realized the video might be distracting. This was because I knew it would require a proper description, which would make the first page cluttered and potentially cause the user to lose interest. Instead I opted for the fun slideshow that can be seen when you enter the home page. 

About
The ‘about’ section is the one most similar to the wireframe. However, a notable difference is the fun circular shape of the pictures. Bringing in a lot more character than my previous idea. 

Opening Hours
I believed the ‘opening hours section’ was too small to require a button in the navigation bar that led to it. It could easily be accessed by scrolling past the ‘about section’ or above the ’shop section’. I simply added a fun picture behind the box, one that related to the website’s themes, and changed the timings and dates for when the company was open. It was fairly simple to implement. 

Musical Instruments/Shop Section
In the shop section I created multiple boxes to contain different types of musical instruments. Unlike the original wireframe, the final placement of the pictures were a lot more cluttered, to spice up the page a little more. I also opted not to have a description for each picture. 

Funnily enough, the difficult part of this section was finding pictures that fit the color pallet and theme of the website. I also had a lot of trouble with the white boxes found above the price for each music type. This was the first time I had to work with css files so it was difficult for me to figure out. I eventually managed to discover a way to get rid of them, however I despised the way the page looked without them, as it made it look messy. In the end I chose to keep the white box, much to my dismay. 

Each picture has a “learn more” button. These buttons lead the user to a different page for each type of instrument. Creating these links was a pretty interesting and exciting experience. I knew I wanted the booking page to be simple so I had taken the box found in the ‘contacts’ section and put it for each type of instrument. I then added a drop-down button for the date, timing, and instrument. This was a bit difficult to implement as the original ‘contacts’ section did not have a drop down button. I had to personally implement a drop-down section by using other elements found on the website. In the end, as tiring as it was to implement, I believe it enhances the experience of the website.

Lastly, I made sure that the date, timing, and instrument were accurate for whatever type the user clicked on. Each instrument was available on the same date and time, Monday to Friday from 8AM to 6PM, as these are the opening hours of the store. However, the type of instrument was different for each page, so I went in and added in all the available instruments for that type, for example: piano for keyboard, trumpet for brass, etc. 

Video
The video section is the one part in which I felt I was going into completely blind. The site did not have a section in which the video could be put into, unlike the images. Due to this I had to improvise the majority of the implementation process. Since I felt I had no place to put the video I added a drop-down button to the shop section in the navigation bar, and put the link for the video page there. Through the help of fellow classmates and the internet I was able to upload my video and put it onto the page. Alongside a small description of the connection of the video to the site. 

Reviews
On one hand, the reviews section was one of the easiest things I had to add, which is great since it was not on my wireframe. All I had to do was add in reviews that related to my theme. However, it was also one of the hardest things to edit as some colors would simply not change despite me going through the css files multiple times. Due to this, the review section is bright orange and I was sadly unable to change it. 

Contacts
Contacts were also pretty easy to implement, I had no issues for the majority of this section. However, much to my surprise, I realized that the label before the name has been changed to a different color, making it blend into the background. This was not the case before and I did not see how I could have changed it as I hadn’t spent much time changing the colors in that section. Annoyingly enough, I was unable to fix it. There was no code to change the color in the css files or the index. 

The map is one of my favorite parts of this website. All I really had to do was add in an email and this section was complete.

Footer
The footer was thankfully pretty easy to implement, which is a good thing considering it was not a part of my original wireframe. However, my main problem was trying to change the color of the wave. It had taken me multiple tries to change the color but to no avail. Funnily enough, I ended up figuring it out by complete accident, causing me to understand the way this code works even more. Finally, I just had to add some extra information and enter the links to the social media sites listed below. 

Expectations and Goals:

The final product ended up going way beyond my expectations. I am extremely happy with my work and am very surprised at the amount of things I was able to achieve through this project. I managed to go beyond my goals of making a simple website with just one page for content and I came out of it with a ton of knowledge on coding in general.
